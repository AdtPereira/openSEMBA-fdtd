# semba-fdtd

In a nutshell, semba-fdtd capabilities are

+ Cluster working capabilites through MPI.
+ Multiple threads per processor through OpenMP.
+ Closed/symmetric problems by means of PEC and PMC conditions.
+ Open problems by means of PML boundary conditions (CPML formulation) or by Mur ABCs.
+ Non-uniformly meshed domains by means of mesh-grading techniques.
+ Bulk lossless and lossy dielectrics.
+ Materials with frequency dependent relative permittivity and/or permeability, with an arbitrary number of complex-conjugate pole-residue pairs.
+ Bulk anisotropic lossless and lossy dielectrics.
+ Equivalent models of multilayered skin-depth materials.
+ Branched multiwires:
+ Junctions of wires of different radii.

  1. Junctions of multiwires.
  2. Wire bundles.
  3. Loaded with p.u.l resistance and inductance wires.
  4. Grounding through lumped elements.

+ Plane-wave illumination with arbitrary time variation.
+ Multiple planewaves illumination for reverberation chamber modeling.
+ Hertzian dipole sources.
+ Equivalent Huygens surfaces.
+ Low frequency thin composites and lossy surfaces.
+ Thin slots.
+ Time, frequency and transfer function probes .
+ Near-to-far field transformation.

# Usage

## Running from release

It is important to point out the repository has dependencies which are available as submodules. It is necessary to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from the root folder before running any `cmake` or `build` commands.

### Windows

Install intel runtime libraries: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html


### Linux


## Compilation and testing

Tests must be run from the root folder. `python` wrapper test assumes that `semba-fdtd` has been compiled successfully and is located in folder `build/bin/`. For intel compilation it also assumes that the intel runtime libraries are accessible.

## Running cases

`semba-fdtd` uses the following [format](doc/smbjson.md) as input files.
