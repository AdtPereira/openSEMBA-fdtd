# The `mtln` solver module

This module allows to solve networks of multiconductor transmission line bundles in the time domain. 
In the context of transmission line theory, a working definition of each of the terms above is:

* A **multiconductor tranmission line** is tranmission line composed of more than one conductor (and the reference conductor), i.e a tranmssion line composed of 3 or more conductors, where one of them is taken as the reference.
* A **bundle** is a series of shielded transmission lines grouped together. A bundle can contain other bundles. 
* A **network** is a series of interconnected transmission lines, multiconductor tranmission lines and/or bundles.

It also includes the following features, representing physical rather than topological properties of the transmission lines:

* The possibility to include dispersive elements, i.e. elements whose properties depend on the frequency of the excitation
* The effect of transfer impedances between a shield and the shielded conductores therein. Real-life shields are not perfect, and the currents circulating on the shields induce a voltage on the conductors inside them. These transfer impedances are often frequency-dependent, and their treatment is similar to that of dispersive elements. 
* The possibility to simulate non-homogeneous tranmission lines, i.e. transmission lines whose per-unit-length parameters (inductance, capacitance, resistance and conductance) depend on the position along the transmission line. This can be used to simulate lumped non-dispersive elements on the TL.

# Multiconductor Transmission Lines #

The MTL method assumes a quasi-TEM propagation applicable in systems that can be decomposed on groups of conductors with constant cross-sections, i.e., translational symmetry. This assumption permits us to relate the voltages and currents on each conductor with per-unit-length parameters [@Paul2007]. For a
lossless line with (N + 1) conductors, these relationships can be expressed in the following form 

$$
\begin{align}
	\partial_z \{V\} &= -[\textrm{R}]\{I\}  - [\textrm{L}] \, \partial_t \{I\} \\
    \partial_z \{I\} &= -[\textrm{G}]\{V\}  - [\textrm{C}] \, \partial_t \{V\} 
\end{align} 
$$

with $\{V\}(z,t) = \left[ V_1 \, V_2 \, ... V_N \right]^T$ being a vector of the voltages with respect to a conductor taken as ground and $\{I\} (z,t) = \left[ I_1 \, I_2 \, ... I_N \right]^T$ is a vector of currents on each of these conductors. 
The matrices $[\textrm{L}]$ and $[\textrm{C}]$ represent the inductance and capacitance per unit length between all conductors.
$\textrm{[R]}$ and $\textrm{[G]}$ represent the losses in the transmission line: resistance (along conductors) and conductance (between conductors) per unit length, respectively.

(1) is discretized using the finite-difference time-domain technique (FDTD) described in [@Paul2007], leading to the following voltage and current update equations:

$$
	\begin{align}
		\{V\}^{n+1}_{k} &= \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}[\textrm{C}] + \frac{\Delta z}{2}[\textrm{G}] \right)^{-1} \left[ \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}[\textrm{C}] - \frac{\Delta z}{2}[\textrm{G}] \right) \{V\}^{n}_{k} -  \left(\{I\}^{n+1/2}_{k}-\{I\}^{n+1/2}_{k-1}\right) \right] \\
		\{I\}^{n+3/2}_{k} &= \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}[\textrm{L}] + \frac{\Delta z}{2}[\textrm{R}] \right)^{-1} \left[ \left(\frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}[\textrm{L}] - \frac{\Delta z}{2}[\textrm{R}] \right) \{I\}^{n+1/2}_{k}  -  \left(\{V\}^{n+1}_{k+1}-\{V\}^{n+1}_{k}\right) \right]
	\end{align} 
$$
where $\Delta t$ and $\Delta z$ are the time and space steps of the discretization, respectively, $k$ locates the voltage nodes and current segments along the discretized MTL, and $n$ locates the current time on the discretized solution time. 

# Networks #

In a general way we call *networks* the connections at the ends of a transmission line. These connections can be to other tranmission lines (_interconnection_ networks, or _junctions_) or to the reference conductor (_termination_ networks). In its simplest form, a network is a short between elements: a short from a transmission line end to the reference conductor, or a short between the ends of tranmission lines. 

_Solving_ a network means computing the voltages on all the external nodes of the network, which are the start or end nodes of the tranmission lines connected to the network.

Using the state variables analysis, the network can be analyzed solving a system with a number of variables equal to the sum of independent inductors and capacitors.
State equations can in principle solve any network. However, the complexity of the method rises noticeably with increasing number of inductors and capactors. The state equations are very different for different types of connections and the potential for generalization is limited. In the current version of the code, networks composed of either a short, a resistance, a capacitance, or a resistance and a capacitance in parallel, in series with an inductor (RCpLs) can be solved.

An alternative, **not yet implemented**, is to use _Spice_ to solve the networks. A call to _Spice_ would be made from within the MTLN solver, giving as an inpout the initial values of the currents and voltages on the network external nodes, and returning the voltages on said nodes.

## Dispersive elements ##

Dispersive elements are those whose properties depend on frequency. The solver works in the time-domain, thus an implementation of the dispersive properties in the time domain is necessary. The implementation proceeds with the following steps:

1. A rational approximation of the frequency-dependent impedance of the dispersive element is written using the [vector-fitting technique](https://www.sintef.no/en/software/vector-fitting/). In this approximation, the impedance can be expressed as a sum of rational functions (poles/residues pairs) and optionally a constant term and a term proportional to the frequency:

    $$Z(s) \simeq d\,+\,se\,+\,\sum\limits_{i=1}\frac{r_i}{s-p_i}\,+\,\sum\limits_{i=1}\frac{r^*_i}{s-p^*_i}$$

    where $s\,=\,j\omega$, and $r_i$ and $p_i$ are the _i_-th residue and pole


2. In the time domain, the products of frequency-dependent terms are expressed as convolutions:

   $$\frac{d\hat{V}(z, w)}{dz} = -\hat{Z}(w)\cdot\hat{I}(z, w) - l\frac{d\hat{I}(z, w)}{dI} \rightarrow 
    \frac{dV(z, t)}{dz} = -Z(t)*I(z, t) - l\frac{dI(z, t)}{dI} $$

3. If the rational approximation of $Z(w)$ is substituted in the convolution:

    $$Z(t)*I(z, t) = \int_o^t Z(\tau) I(z, t-\tau)d\tau = dI + e\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} + \sum\limits_{i} r_i \int_o^t e^{p_i t}I(t-\tau) d\tau$$

4. Following [Sarto](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/809798) the integral in the last term is computed applying the piecewise linear recursive formulation proposed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/391136). Using the time discretization described before, the last term takes the following form:

    $$\sum\limits_{i} r_i \int_o^t e^{p_i t}I(t-\tau) d\tau = \sum\limits_{i} \varphi_i$$

    where

    $$
    \begin{align}
        \varphi^{n}_{i} &= I^{n+3/2}_{k}\,q_{1i} + I^{n+1/2}_{k}\,q_{2i} + \varphi^{n}_{i}\,q_{3i}\\
        q_{1i} &= \frac{\alpha_i}{\beta_i}\,(e^{\beta_i}\,-\,\beta_i\,-\,1)\\
        q_{2i} &= \frac{\alpha_i}{\beta_i}\,(1\,+\,e^{\beta_i}(\beta_i\,-\,1))\\
    	q_{3i} &= e^{\beta_{i}}\textrm{,} \hspace{10pt} \alpha_i\,=\,\frac{r_i}{p_i}\textrm{,} \hspace{10pt} \beta_i\,=\,p_i\,\delta t
    \end{align}
    $$

5. Using this expression for the convolution term, the discretized update relation for the current yields:

	$$I^{n+3/2}_{k} = F_{1}^{-1}[F_{2}I^{n+1/2}_{k} - (V^{n+1}_{k+1}-V^{n+1}_{k}) \Delta z \sum_{i}q_{3i}\varphi^{n-1}_{i}]$$

    where
    
    $$
    \begin{align}
        F_{1} &= ( \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}L + \frac{\Delta z}{2}d + \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}e + \Delta z \sum_{i}q_{1i}) \\
        F_{2} &= ( \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}L - \frac{\Delta z}{2}d + \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}e - \Delta z \sum_{i}q_{2i})
    \end{align}
    $$
